#Control Statements
#Loops help automate repetitive tasks

#1.FOR LOOP: A for loop is used to iterate over items like lists, strings, or ranges.

#Example1:
for i in range(5):  # i takes values from 0 to 4
    print(i)       # prints numbers 0 through 4

# Example2: Using a for loop to iterate over a list and print each item squared

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # List of numbers

for num in numbers:
    squared = num ** 2
    print(f"The square of {num} is {squared}")                  #The square of 1 is 1
                                                                #The square of 2 is 4
                                                                #The square of 3 is 9
                                                                #The square of 4 is 16
                                                                #The square of 5 is 25

#Example:3 
# User's workout record over a week
workout_log = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
current_streak = 0
longest_streak = 0
for day in workout_log:
   if day == 1:
    current_streak += 1
    if current_streak > longest_streak:
       longest_streak = current_streak

else:
    current_streak = 0 # Streak breaks
print("Longest workout streak:", longest_streak)          #Longest workout streak: 5                                                        



#2.WHILE LOOP: A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.
# Initialize the condition variable
count = 0  

# Continue to loop while count is less than 5
while count < 5:
    print(f"Iteration {count + 1}")
    
    # Update condition variable to eventually break the loop
    count += 1

print("Loop has ended.")                           #Iteration 1                           #Iteration 1
                                                   #Iteration 2
                                                   #Iteration 3
                                                   #Iteration 4
                                                   #Iteration 5
                                                   #Loop has ended.

#Example1
